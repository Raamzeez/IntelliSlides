                        If a user changes their personal information via their
                        Google Account, such as their first name, IntelliSlides
                        will get the updated information from Google on the next
                        login by the user, thus updating the data in our
                        database.

                    <li style={{ fontSize: 17 }}>Delete</li>
                    <p>
                        If a user is logged into the app, they can click the
                        "Delete" button on their profile card. and their google
                        id token is removed from the browser, and their
                        corresponding data is entirely deleted from the MongoDB
                        backend. This is not a reversible process.
