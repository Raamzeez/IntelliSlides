<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>This branch is for testing purposes. Once features on a particular branch are completed, developers should create a pull request to merge into this branch. If the pull request is approved and successful, a build is automatically created by Vercel and deployed at <a href="https://intellislides-git-development-raamzeez.vercel.app/">https://intellislides-git-development-raamzeez.vercel.app/</a>. Users must authenticate with Vercel to view the build. This branch is used as a preview branch to test and interact with the features that are going to be released with the next version of IntelliSlides.
